eventually this will be my ansible on raspberry pi kube install hacks

I've been looking at various links which will be listed in links.txt and have been using parts of a couple different tutorials.  Doing this I was able to setup a 4 node kubernetes v1.9.0 cluster on raspberry pi 2's

this is currently a work in progress and a dumping ground for useful stuff that I will someday attempt to convert into Ansible
